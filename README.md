# Quantum Targeted Energy Transfer Optimization

This repository contains code that was used for producing the results found in the relevant paper "Quantum Targeted Energy Transfer through Machine Learning Tools" ([arXiv:2212.00556](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00556)).

## Cite

If any code from this repository is used for further scientific work on dimer or trimer configurations of non linear transfer, it should be cited using the citation file provided, using the `Cite this repository` side button.

## Installation

To install and use the code contained in this repository you first need to set up the dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/JAndronis/Quantum-Targeted-Energy-Transfer.git
cd Quantum-Targeted-Energy-Transfer
make
```

## Running QTET Application

We have implemented a recommended use-case of the package we developed into an application called `qtet.py` in the `src` directory. The application can be simply run, after running the installation commands, like so:

```sh
make run
```

assuming the user is in the directory of the repository.
